  # Fix RLS policies for accounts table

  1. Security Changes
    - Update RLS policies on `accounts` table to allow anonymous users
    - Allow INSERT, SELECT, and UPDATE operations for anon role
    - This matches the current application design which uses anonymous access

  2. Changes Made
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Create new policies that allow anon role access
    - Maintain data security while enabling the application to function
